defmodule Absynthe.Supervision.Ground do
  @moduledoc """
  Root supervisor for the Absynthe application.

  ## Overview

  Ground is the top-level supervisor that orchestrates all Absynthe subsystems.
  It establishes the foundational supervision tree that manages the lifecycle
  of actors, entities, and their associated registries.

  The name "Ground" reflects its role as the foundational layer upon which the
  entire Absynthe actor system is built - much like electrical ground provides
  a common reference point, this supervisor provides a stable base for all
  actor operations.

  ## Supervision Tree Structure

  The Ground supervisor uses a `:one_for_one` strategy and starts children
  in a carefully ordered sequence:

  ```
  Ground (one_for_one)
  ├─ ActorRegistry    - Registry for looking up actors by name
  ├─ EntityRegistry   - Registry for looking up entities
  └─ ActorSupervisor  - DynamicSupervisor for actor processes
  ```

  ### Supervision Strategy

  The `:one_for_one` strategy means that if any child process terminates,
  only that process is restarted. This is appropriate because:

  1. **Registry Independence** - Each registry operates independently. If one
     fails, the other can continue serving requests.

  2. **Actor Isolation** - The ActorSupervisor can restart independently
     without affecting the registries. Registered actor names will be cleaned
     up automatically when processes die.

  3. **Fault Tolerance** - A crash in one subsystem doesn't cascade to others,
     maximizing system availability.

  ### Child Startup Order

  Children are started in the order they appear in the child specification list:

  1. **ActorRegistry** - Started first so that actors can register names
     immediately upon startup.

  2. **EntityRegistry** - Started second to enable entity lookups as soon
     as actors begin spawning entities.

  3. **ActorSupervisor** - Started last because it depends on the registries
     being available to properly manage actor lifecycle.

  This ordering ensures that infrastructure is in place before components
  that depend on it are started.

  ## Configuration

  Ground accepts the following configuration options:

  - `:name` - The registered name for the Ground supervisor itself.
    Default: `Absynthe.Supervision.Ground`

  - `:actor_supervisor_name` - The registered name for the ActorSupervisor.
    Default: `Absynthe.Supervision.ActorSupervisor`

  - `:actor_registry_name` - The registered name for the ActorRegistry.
    Default: `Absynthe.Registry.Actor`

  - `:entity_registry_name` - The registered name for the EntityRegistry.
    Default: `Absynthe.Registry.Entity`

  ## Usage

  ### Starting Ground as part of an Application

      def start(_type, _args) do
        children = [
          {Absynthe.Supervision.Ground, []}
        ]

        opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
        Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
      end

  ### Starting Ground with custom configuration

      {:ok, ground} = Absynthe.Supervision.Ground.start_link(
        name: MyApp.Ground,
        actor_registry_name: MyApp.ActorRegistry
      )

  ### Starting Ground standalone

      # Use default names
      {:ok, ground} = Absynthe.Supervision.Ground.start_link([])

  ## Implementation Notes

  ### Registry Design

  Both ActorRegistry and EntityRegistry are expected to be implemented using
  Elixir's built-in `Registry` module with the following characteristics:

  - **ActorRegistry** - A `:unique` registry mapping actor names to PIDs.
    This ensures each actor name maps to exactly one process.

  - **EntityRegistry** - A `:unique` registry mapping entity references to
    their host actor PIDs. This enables fast entity lookup without scanning
    all actors.

  ### ActorSupervisor Design

  The ActorSupervisor is expected to be a `DynamicSupervisor` that:

  - Manages actor processes with a `:one_for_one` restart strategy
  - Allows actors to be started and stopped dynamically at runtime
  - Provides restart limits to prevent cascade failures
  - Integrates with ActorRegistry for name registration

  ### Forward Compatibility

  This module is designed to gracefully handle cases where registry or
  supervisor modules don't exist yet. If a child module is not yet
  implemented, the supervisor will fail to start with a descriptive error,
  making it clear what needs to be implemented next.

  ## Error Handling

  If Ground fails to start, it may be due to:

  1. **Missing Dependencies** - One or more child modules (ActorRegistry,
     EntityRegistry, ActorSupervisor) are not yet implemented.

  2. **Name Conflicts** - A process is already registered with one of the
     configured names.

  3. **Resource Exhaustion** - The system is unable to allocate resources
     for the supervisor or its children.

  Check the logs for specific error messages that indicate which component
  failed to start.

  ## Future Extensions

  As Absynthe evolves, Ground may be extended to supervise additional
  subsystems:

  - **DataspaceSupervisor** - For managing shared dataspace instances
  - **NetworkSupervisor** - For distributed actor communication
  - **PersistenceSupervisor** - For actor state persistence and recovery
  - **TelemetrySupervisor** - For observability and monitoring
